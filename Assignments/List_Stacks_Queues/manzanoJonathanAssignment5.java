 *
 * Description: Define a class named Point with tow data fields x and y to
 * represent a point's x- and y-coordinates. Implement the Comparable interface
 * for the comparing the points on x-coordinates. If two points have the same
 * x-coordinates, compare their y-coordinates.
 * 
 * Define a class named CompareY that implements Comparator<Point>. Implement
 * the compare method to compare two points on their y-coordinates. If two
 * points have the same y-coordinates, compare their x-coordinates.
 * 
 * Randomly create 100 points and apply the Arrays.sort method to display the
 * points in increasing order of their x-coordinates, and increasing order of
 * their y-coordinates, respectively.
